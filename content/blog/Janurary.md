Connections:

This month is one of brutal growth and painful acceptance. My wife and I are hitting the 1 year mark in the home buying process, My job is in flux with tons of change, and we have been riding the sickness marry-go-round for the last month. Itâ€™s been hard to stay positive about life in general but media has always had a strong connection to my emotions. I studied film in school for this very reason and I have a theory that you stumble into the media that you need to see and hear when you need it most. More on this theory later.
